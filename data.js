Later he entered the teaching profession and joined the Training College the year before the outbreak of war. He volunteered for service with the Samoan Expeditionary Force and after the peaceful occupation of the islands, he returned to New Zealand. While recruiting his health at Whangarei he volunteered for service in France, joined the Rifle Brigade and left New Zealand as a corporal in the First Battalion of the N.Z.R.B. He was killed during the first battle of the Somme on 15th September, 1916. Les. Jack, following the example of his brother Will, took a prominent part in all school activities and speedily made his mark at football, earning his place in the school fifteen by sheer grit. He was a popular boy, his unfailing and buoyant spirits endeared him to all. He did creditable work in the classroom, was indefatigable in the pursuit of out-door recreations, and was loved by all who came in contact with him for his unfailing cheerfulness and solid work."

He was killed in action on August 9th, 1916. Olaf was known in school as a boxer of some repute, end a successful student. Of a frank and cheery disposition he became prominent in all school activities and could be relied upon to ''stick it out'' to the last. Absolutely without fear his actions sometimes seemed to be foolhardy and it was perhaps this fearlessness which caused him to lose his life. We shall mourn Olaf as a gentleman, keen soldier, and one who took a sincere interest in the welfare of his old school. Like Harry Cameron he, too, made a special trip to see us all just before embarking."

Leaving school h? entered the service of the Education Board, Auckland; was at the Training College in 1915, and enlisted in the 13th Reinforcements. When on final leave Frank took the opportunity of revisiting his ?ld school and came on the same day that six or seven old boys, who had joined the 12ths, were calling to say good-bye. Frank was proud of being in the Devil's Own, as the 13ths were known in camp and took in great good humour the banter he received owing to the recent raid on the canteen in campâ€”something put down to the lively manners  of the boys of the 13th Reinforcement. Frank would carry on in the battlefield as a cheery, bravo-hearted  boy would do, a favourite with all. He was wounded severely in a voluntary raid at Armentieres and died of wounds on March 1st in Boulogne."

        bio: "Henry Lee Rouse, son of Mr Rouse, of Hukerenui. He came to the school after the second term in 1910, leaving at the end of 1912. Entering camp in 1916 he left with the 14ths. He did not manage to reach France, but was invalided back from England and died in the Auckland Hospital in December, 1916. Rouse was a boy of splendid physique and of a very quiet, retiring disposition. During his term at school he was a member of the school fifteen and showed that he possessed the the qualities that go to make a successful forward. Being a train-boy the opportunity of knowing him well was denied us."

Wilkinson had intended to take a Government appointment after sitting for Senior Civil Service, but was attracted to the law before he completed his course of study. He left with the 8th Reinforcements and was among those who lost their lives in the battle of the Somme, September, 1916. Harold was distinguished mostly by his quiet, retiring disposition. There was, however, a great deal behind his reserve and he proved his worth and manhood by enlisting at the earliest opportunity."
